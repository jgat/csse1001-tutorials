<h1>Week 5 Tutorial: Classes and Objects</h1>

<h2>Processing Data in a String</h2>
<p>
A for loop allows you to iterate over an iterable sequence. This
means that you can construct a loop that will run once for each element in a 
sequence (for example, each value in a list or each character in a string).
</p>

<p>
In this task, we are given a string from which we wish to extract every character
before a particular character sequence is encountered.
</p>

<p>
Write a function, <tt><span class="builtin">string_before</span></tt>, which
takes two strings as arguments. The first is the string from which we aim to
extract the characters. The second is the delimiting sequence.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Hint:</b>
<p>
A <tt><span class="builtin">break</span></tt> statement can be used to terminate 
a while or for loop.
</p>
<p>
A <tt><span class="builtin">continue</span></tt> statement will cause a loop to
immediately move to the next item in the sequence.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span> for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if item % 2:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elif item == 6:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print item
<span class="result"></span> 2
<span class="result"></span> 4
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Using Enumerate</h2>

<p>it is often useful for a <tt><span class="builtin">for</span></tt> loop to
be able to access both the value of some element in a sequence and its index at
the same time. We can do this using the 
<tt><span class="builtin">enumerate</span></tt> function.
</p>

<p>
<tt><span class="builtin">enumerate</span></tt> generates a sequence of tuples, 
where the first item in the tuple is the index of the current in the sequence 
and the second item is its value. A <tt><span class="builtin">for</span></tt> 
loop can the iterate over both items at once.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span> for index, item in enumerate('abc'):
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print index, item
<span class="result"></span> 0 a
<span class="result"></span> 1 b
<span class="result"></span> 2 c
</div>

<p>
The message below has been encoded using a very simple scheme: a random letter 
has been inserted before every second letter in the original message (starting 
with the first letter, ie indexed from 0).
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;encode(<span class="string">'Test of encoding function')</span>
<span class="result"></span> 'lTretsxty qocfz aeunrcoomdliknegv zfzuwnfcrtzixotn'
</pre>

<p>
In this task, you will need to write a <tt><span class="builtin">decode</span></tt>
that takes a single encoded string as an argument and returns the original message.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;decode(<span class="string">'lTretsxty qocfz aeunrcoomdliknegv zfzuwnfcrtzixotn')</span>
<span class="result"></span> 'Test of encoding function'
</pre>

<p>
This can also be done using string slicing in just one line!
</p>

<h2>For Loops and File I/O</h2>

<p>
When designing real applications or scripts in python, you will almost always want to read data from and write data to files on the hard drive. Python handles file reads and writes through file objects, which are created by the <tt><span class="builtin">open</span></tt> function
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> f = open(<span class="string">'psn_paswords.txt'</span>, <span class="string">'U'</span>)
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> f
<span class="result"></span> open file 'psn_passwords.txt', mode 'U' at 0x1016efc90
</div>

<p>
Files are iterable objects in python, which means you can use a for loop to look at their contents one line at a time, just as you can use them to process characters in strings and items in lists.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;for lineNum, line in enumerate(f):
<span class="prompt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print i, line </span>
<span class="result"></span>
<span class="result">0 sony@psn.net guest</span>

</pre>

<p>
Write a function <tt><span class="builtin">parse_file</span></tt> that takes one argument, 
<tt><span class="builtin">filename</span></tt>, which points to a file containing python code
and extracts information about functions in that file.
You can create such a file by combining solutions to previous tutorial questions 
or you can use the example file provided on the website.
</p>

<p>
Your function should parse this file to return a list of tuples of the form
(<tt><span class="builtin">linenum</span></tt>, <tt><span class="builtin">function</span></tt>,
<tt><span class="builtin">args</span></tt>). <tt><span class="builtin">linenum</span></tt>
is the line number of a function, <tt><span class="builtin">function</span></tt> is
the name of that function and <tt><span class="builtin">args</span></tt> is a tuple containing the argument names (if any).
