<h1>Week 9 Tutorial: Introduction to GUI Design</h1>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>If you are writng a program that is going to be used by other people, then you will most 
likely want to include a GUI (graphical user interface). Python ships with a GUI toolkit known
as Tkinter; this is what IDLE is written in.</p>
<p>In this course, we will use Tkinter to introduce you to the basics of GUI design.
An excellent resource on this toolkit can be found at <a href='http://effot.org/tkinterbook/'>http://effot.org/tkinterbook/</a>.</p>
<p>An interface in Tkinter is built from a collection of widgets. Each widget
is a Tkinter class that is designed for a specific purpose: the Button widget
is a standard button, the Label widget a tool for displaying static text, the
Frame widget a container for other widgets, and so on.</p>    
<p>These widgets are arranged on-screen through what is known as a geometry
manager. We will be using the pack geometry manager. It's probably easiest to
think about pack as creating 'stacks' of widgets.</p>
<p>When you pack a widget, you tell Tkinter which side of the window you want
to place it against. The first widget packed to a particular side is placed
right against that edge of the window. Subsequent widgets are packed up
against this one.</p>

<h2>Displaying a Widget</h2>
<p>There are two steps in creating a GUI widget in Tkinter. Firstly, the widget
itself must be created, as an instance of the appropriate class. Any
configuration information information relevant to the widget, such as the text
it should display or the callback function it should run when interacted with,
is given here as a keyword argument.<br>For example, this is how one might
choose to create an instance of the Button widget:</p>
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>btn = Button(self, text="I'm a button", command=self.print_hello)
</pre>
<p>Secondly, the widget itself must be <i>packed</i>. Keyword arguments to the
pack method control how and where the widget is displayed on the screen. These arguments should never be given to the class directly, as some online examples won't do.<br>
Packing the Button widget can be done like so:</p>
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>btn.pack(side=TOP)
</pre>
<p>It is possible to position the widgets with more precision by making use of the anchor
keyword arguments. Widgets can be anchored to compass directions (e.i. N, S, E and W).
For example, the following code would pack btn in the top left (provided it was
the first widget to be packed):
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>btn.pack(side=TOP, anchor=N)
</pre>
<p>You have been provided with a simple
<tt><span class="builtin">HelloWorld</span></tt> interface (see the course website).
You will be able to observe a button, a label and a spinbox in this example.
The button, when pressed, will print 'Hello!' in IDLE. The spinbox has four
values: 'I', 'am', 'a' and 'Spinbox'.
<p>Your job is to add another button to the interface, below the spinbox. This
button should be anchored to the right hand side of the window, should read
'Button 2' and should print 'Hello again!' when clicked.</p>

<h2>Frames</h2>
<p>It's not very satisfactory to just stack widgets from the top, bottom or
side of the screen; such an approach lacks flexibility (for example, to place
two buttons side-by-side beneath a label).</p>
<p>We can overcome this limitation by creating frames to store widgets in, and
then arranging these frames and their component widgets appropriately using
pack.</p>
<p>Every widget in Tk has the concept of a master. You may have noticed that
when we created the buttons and labels in the previous example, the first
argument we provided to their contructor was self. This is the button or
label's master.</p>
<p>Each widget is drawn inside of its master. When we pack a widget, it is
packed inside and with respect to this master. What this means is that when we
pack the widget with, say, side=TOP, it from the top of this master widget.</p>
<p>The example below has three levels of the master-parent relationship.
This first is the App, which represents the entire window. The second is the
HelloWorld class from the previous exercise (which inherited from Frame). This
is packed inside the App. Inside the HelloWorld class is a label and a frame
which itself contains two buttons and a spinbox.<p>

<p>Your task is to modify the original HelloWorld class to reproduce this
display.</p>

<h2>Interacting with Widgets</h2>
<p>You will often want to interact with widgets after you have created them.
For example, you often need to change the text that is displayed in a Label, or
get information that a user has entered in an Entry (textbox).</p>
<p>It is possible to reconfigure tany property of a Tk widget by using the
<tt><span class="builtin">configure</span></tt> method. This method accepts the
same keyword arguments as the constructor for a widget. For example, the
following code will change the text of the label
<tt><span class="builtin">self._lbl</span></tt>.</p>
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>self._lbl.configure(text="I've been changed!")
</pre>
<p>Controls that accept user input will define methods for accessing that
input. For example, to get the contents of a textbox, you can use the
<tt><span class="builtin">Entry.get</span></tt> method.</p>
<p>Create a new class which inherits from
<tt><span class="builtin">Frame</span></tt> (as HelloWorld did) and which
displays the interface shown in the image below. It should change the colour
of the label text and the associated label strings to any valid colour the user
inputs in the Entry.</p>

<h2>Message Boxes in Tkinter</h2>
<p>Occasionally a user will interact with a program in a way that requires
a pop-up message box. This can be achieved in Tkinter by using the
<tt><span class="builtin">tkMessageBox</span></tt> module. For now, we will
only concern ourselves with the module's <tt><span class="builtin">showerror()</span></tt>
function. The call required to obtain an error message box is of the form:
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>import tkMessageBox
<span class="prompt"></span>tkMessageBox.showerror(title, message [, options])
</pre>
The title and message arguments dictate the text that will appear in the
error box.</p>

<p>Using your code from the previous exercise as a foundation, add functionality
that will display an error message box if no text has been entered into the
Entry widget when the 'Change Colour' button is pressed.</p>
