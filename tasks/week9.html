<h1>Week 9 Tutorial: Graphical User Interfaces 1</h1>

<h2>Blue And Green</h2>

<p>
In this week's tutorial, we will build a small application which has a
<tt>Label</tt> and some commands to change the colour of the label.
</p>

<p>
Download the file <a href="week9.py">week9.py</a>, which contains code to
run a simple application which greets the user when they click the button.
Run this code and examine how it works. Modify this code to show the following
layout:
</p>

<p>
Note that there should be a vertical padding of 10 pixels around the buttons.
If the user increases the window size, the buttons should stay at the bottom,
and the label should stay rougly in the centre of the window.
</p>

<p>
Next, modify the class so that clicking the buttons modify the text and colour
of the label, as follows (and similarly for the 'Green' button):
</p>

<h2>What... is Your Favourite Colour?</h2>

<p>
We will now expand the program to allow the user to enter their own choice of
colour. Modify the program to show the following layout:
</p>

<p>
Note that the 10 pixel vertical padding has been removed from the two buttons,
and there is a 10 pixel padding around all four sides of the bottom row. If the
user increases the window size, the <tt>Entry</tt> widget should grow
horizontally.
</p>

<p>
Next, modify the class so that the 'Change it!' button changes the colour and
text of the label based on the text in the entry widget. For example,
</p>

<p>
(Try some of <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/colors.htm#M3">these
colours</a> in your program!)
</p>

<h2>That's Not a Colour!</h2>

<p>
Modify the program so that if the text in the entry widget isn't a colour, an
error box appears, for example:
</p>

<p>
(Hint: if a colour is invalid, Python will raise a <tt>TclError</tt>.)
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Hint: Tkinter Error Messages</b>

<p>
To display an error message box, we use the <tt>tkMessageBox</tt> library.
First, import <tt>tkMessageBox</tt>, then
<tt>tkMessageBox.showerror(<span class="string">"title"</span>, <span class="string">"message"</span>)</tt>
will display an error box with the given title and message.
</p>
</div>
