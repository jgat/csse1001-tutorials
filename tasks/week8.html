<h2>Webcrawling</h2>

<p>
If you're building a search engine, you need to start by having a list of all
webpages on the Internet. The simple way to find webpages is to start with a
known webpage, and follow all the links to different pages, and repeating the
procedure on those webpages. (This method is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler" class="foo">Web crawling</a>,
since it is akin to the way a spider crawls along its web.)
</p>

<p>
For this task, we will write a program which takes a URL for a webpage, and
finds all links on that page. To do this, we'll need to learn a bit about HTML,
and the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html">HTMLParser</a>.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>HTML Basics</b>
<p>
In HTML, text is annotated with <em>tags</em>, which affect the way the text is
displayed. For example, to make text appear in <strong>bold face</strong>, we
put it inside <tt>&lt;strong&gt;</tt> tags. To see more tags, view the source of
this webpage in your browser.
</p>

<p>
Tags can also have attributes; attributes have a name and a value. For
example, the tag <tt>&lt;img src="img/spam.jpg" alt="Spam"&gt;</tt> is an
<tt>img</tt> tag with the two attributes <tt>src="img/spam.jpg"</tt> and
<tt>alt="Spam"</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Of particular interest to us is the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"><tt>a</tt> tag</a>, which describes a link. The
URL to be linked is put in the attribute called <tt>href</tt>. This HTML document
contains multiple <a target="_blank" href="http://example.com/">examples</a>
of this.
</p>
</div>

<div class="important">
<b>HTMLParser</b>

<p>
Python contains a library called <tt>HTMLParser</tt> which can help interpret
HTML text. The <tt>HTMLParser</tt> class has a method <tt>feed</tt>, which takes
a string. For each HTML tag within the string, the class calls its own
<tt>handle_starttag</tt> method. By default, this method does nothing, but
subclasses can overwrite that behaviour.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Start with the sample code below (available as
<a href="week8_webcrawler.py" class="foo">week8_webcrawler.py</a>). The function
<tt>find_links</tt> takes a URL (for example, the URL of this webpage), and
calls the <tt>feed</tt> method of a <tt>LinkParser</tt> class (which has not yet
been defined).
</p>

<pre>
<span class="keyword">from</span> HTMLParser <span class="keyword">import</span> HTMLParser
<span class="keyword">import</span> urllib2

<span class="comment"># TODO: write your solution here</span>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="classordef">LinkParser</span>(...):
    ...

<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="classordef">find_links</span>(url):
    <span class="string">"""Return a list of links from the given webpage"""</span>
    <span class="comment"># Open the webpage and read the HTML text</span>
    fd = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    text = fd.read()
    fd.close()

    <span class="comment"># Create a parser instance and feed it the text</span>
    parser = LinkParser()
    parser.feed(text)

    <span class="comment"># TODO: write your solution here</span>
</pre>

<p>Make the following modifications to this code:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>
Write a class <tt>LinkParser</tt> which inherits from <tt>HTMLParser</tt>, and
write a method <tt>handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs)</tt> which prints out the
two parameters <tt>tag</tt> and <tt>attrs</tt>. Run the code and determine what
the code is doing, and what values are being given to <tt>handle_starttag</tt>
when it is called. Discuss with others at your table, or with a tutor.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Modify the <tt>handle_starttag</tt> method to print out the <tt>href</tt> attribute
of every link (<tt>a</tt> tag) within the HTML text.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Modify the class so that it stores a list of URLs, and modify the
<tt>handle_starttag</tt> method so that it adds the linked URLs into the list.
Add a method <tt>get_urls</tt> which returns this list, and use that method in
the return value of <tt>find_links</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
An example of the finished code is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> find_links(<span class="string">'<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(location.href); /* because I don't actually know what the URL will be... :P */
</script>'</span>)
<span class="result">['http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler',
 'http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html',
 'http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp',
 'http://example.com/',
 'week8_webcrawler.py']</span>
</pre>
