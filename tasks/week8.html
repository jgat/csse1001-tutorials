<h1>Week 8 Tutorial: Inheritance</h1>

<h2>Extending Students</h2>

<p>
In last week's tutorial, we wrote a <tt>Student</tt> class which aimed to
store, retrieve, and perform computations on, information about a university
student. The file <a href="week8_students.py">week8_students.py</a> contains a
much simpler model of a student; it includes a name, student number, and a list
of courses. Each course has an associated tuition fee.
</p>

<p>
We would like to extend this model to allow for students who live in college.
In addition to paying tuition fees, college students must also pay an extra fee
to live on campus.
Write a class <tt>CollegeStudent</tt> which inherits from <tt>Student</tt>, and
implement the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The constructor should take an extra two arguments, the name of the
    student's college (as a string), and their college fee (as an integer).</li>
<li>Add a method <tt>get_college</tt> which returns the name of the student's
    college.</li>
<li>The <tt>calculate_fees</tt> method of a <tt>CollegeStudent</tt> should
    return the sum of all their tuition fees, plus their college fee.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following shows an example of using this class:</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred = CollegeStudent(<span class="string">"fred"</span>, 43214321, <span class="string">"St. Leo's"</span>, 18000)
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred.get_college()
<span class="result">"St. Leo's"</span>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred.calculate_fees()
<span class="result">18000</span>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred.enrol(<span class="string">'CSSE1001'</span>, 1000)
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred.enrol(<span class="string">'LAWS1000'</span>, 1300)
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred.calculate_fees()
<span class="result">20300</span>
</pre>

<h2>Webcrawling</h2>

<p>
If you're building a search engine, you need to start by having a list of all
webpages on the Internet. The simple way to find webpages is to start with a
known webpage, and follow all the links to different pages, and repeating the
procedure on those webpages. (This method is called
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler" class="foo">Web crawling</a>,
since it is akin to the way a spider crawls along its web.)
</p>

<p>
For this task, we will write a program which takes a URL for a webpage, and
finds all links on that page. To do this, we'll need to learn a bit about HTML,
and the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html">HTMLParser</a>.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>HTML Basics</b>
<p>
In HTML, text is annotated with <em>tags</em>, which affect the way the text is
displayed. For example, to make text appear in <strong>bold face</strong>, we
put it inside <tt>&lt;strong&gt;</tt> tags. To see more tags, view the source of
this webpage in your browser.
</p>

<p>
Tags can also have attributes; attributes have a name and a value. For
example, the tag <tt>&lt;img src="img/spam.jpg" alt="Spam"&gt;</tt> is an
<tt>img</tt> tag with the two attributes <tt>src="img/spam.jpg"</tt> and
<tt>alt="Spam"</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Of particular interest to us is the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"><tt>a</tt> tag</a>, which describes a link. The
URL to be linked is put in the attribute called <tt>href</tt>.<br />For example,
<tt>&lt;a href="http://example.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</tt> produces:
<a href="http://example.com/">link</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="important">
<b>HTMLParser</b>

<p>
Python contains a library called <tt>HTMLParser</tt> which can help interpret
HTML text. The <tt>HTMLParser</tt> class has a method <tt>feed</tt>, which takes
a string. For each HTML tag within the string, the class calls its own
<tt>handle_starttag</tt> method. By default, this method does nothing, but
subclasses can overwrite that behaviour.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Start with the sample code below (available as
<a href="week8_webcrawler.py" class="foo">week8_webcrawler.py</a>). The function
<tt>find_links</tt> takes a URL (for example, the URL of this webpage), and
calls the <tt>feed</tt> method of a <tt>LinkParser</tt> class (which has not yet
been defined).
</p>

<pre>
<span class="keyword">from</span> HTMLParser <span class="keyword">import</span> HTMLParser
<span class="keyword">import</span> urllib2

<span class="comment"># TODO: write your solution here</span>
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="classordef">LinkParser</span>(...):
    ...

<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="classordef">find_links</span>(url):
    <span class="string">"""Return a list of links from the given webpage"""</span>
    <span class="comment"># Open the webpage and read the HTML text</span>
    fd = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    text = fd.read()
    fd.close()

    <span class="comment"># Create a parser instance and feed it the text</span>
    parser = LinkParser()
    parser.feed(text)

    <span class="comment"># TODO: write your solution here</span>
</pre>

<p>Make the following modifications to this code:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>
Write a class <tt>LinkParser</tt> which inherits from <tt>HTMLParser</tt>, and
write a method <tt>handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs)</tt> which prints out the
two parameters <tt>tag</tt> and <tt>attrs</tt>. Run the code and determine what
the code is doing, and what values are being given to <tt>handle_starttag</tt>
when it is called. Discuss with others at your table, or with a tutor.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Modify the <tt>handle_starttag</tt> method to print out the <tt>href</tt> attribute
of every link (<tt>a</tt> tag) within the HTML text.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Modify the class so that it stores a list of URLs, and modify the
<tt>handle_starttag</tt> method so that it adds the linked URLs into the list.
Add a method <tt>get_urls</tt> which returns this list, and use that method in
the return value of <tt>find_links</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
An example of the finished code is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> find_links(<span class="string">'<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(location.href); /* because I don't actually know what the URL will be... :P */
</script>'</span>)
<span class="result">['week8_employees.py',
 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler',
 'http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html',
 'http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp',
 'http://example.com/',
 'week8_webcrawler.py']</span>
</pre>
