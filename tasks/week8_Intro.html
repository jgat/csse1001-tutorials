<h1>Week 8 Tutorial: Inheritance</h1>

<p>In the previous two weeks we have learnt how to define a new class, as well
as some general pointers on designing classes. We wrote a <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt> class which defines methods for getting, among other things, pieces of
information about that Student. </p>

<p>This model for a student can be adapted to modelling employees in a business.
You have been provided with an <tt><span class="builtin">Employee</span></tt> 
class (see the course website) that implents some basic features that may be
useful when modelling an employee.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a <tt><span class="builtin">Manager</span></tt> class
that inherits from <tt><span class="builtin">Employee</span></tt> that adds or
changes the following pieces of functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Override the <tt><span class="builtin">get_vac_days</span></tt> method
        so that the number of vacation days is 10</li>
    <li>Create a <tt><span class="builtin">get_bonus</span></tt> method that
        returns the manager's bonus</li>
    <li>Override the <tt><span class="builtin">get_annual_pay</span></tt>
        method so that it takes the manager's bonus into account</li>
</ul>
