<h1>Week 7 Tutorial: Class Design</h1>

<h2>Class Structure</h2>

<p>
A <tt><span class="builtin">class</span></tt> can be thought of as a blueprint
for a particular type of object. All objects of a certain type have
characteristics (data, or state) and behavior (methods) in common, and so it is
convenient to abstract these qualities into a class.
</p>

<p>
You've been using classes since you first started using python; addition in IDLE
makes use of the <tt><span class="builtin">int</span></tt> class, working with
strings involves the <tt><span class="builtin">str</span></tt> class, lists are
based on the <tt><span class="builtin">list</span></tt> class, and so on.
</p>

<p>
We can define our own classes in a similar way to defining functions. For
example, a basic outline of a Student class might be as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span>class Student(object):
<span class="prompt"></span>    def __init__(self, name):
<span class="prompt"></span>        self.setName(name)
<span class="prompt"></span>
<span class="prompt"></span>    def get_name(self):
<span class="prompt"></span>        return self._name
<span class="prompt"></span>
<span class="prompt"></span>    def set_name(self, name):
<span class="prompt"></span>        self._name = name
</pre>

<p>
Interacting with classes is also quite simple. Here is an example of how to
create an instance of the Person class:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> peter = Student('Peter Griffin')
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> peter
<span class="result"></span><__main__.Student object at 0x103961150>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> peter.get_name()
<span class="result"></span>'Peter Griffin'
</pre>

<p>
Extend this class so that it manages the following pieces of information:
    <ol>
        <li>Date of Birth (a string formatted as <i>ddmmyyyy</i>)</li>
        <li>Student Number</li>
        <li>Degree</li>
        <li>Grades (stored in a list of integers)</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
Write a function, <tt><span class="builtin">get_highest_gpa</span></tt>, that takes
a list of <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt>s as it's only argument
and returns the <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt> with the highest
GPA.
</p>

<h2>Extension</h2>

<p>
Construct a simple class to model a course. This class should handle the course's
acronym, title, teaching semester and class list. Functions should also be
made that allow students to be added to and removed from the class list.<br>
</p>

<p>
Add functionality to the <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt> class
so that each instance is capable of recording the courses that a student has
been enrolled in. You should write methods that allow you to add and remove
a course from the student's record.<br>
Furthermore, you will need to modify the way that grades are stored so that
they become associated with a relevant course.<br>
Write a function, <tt><span class="builtin">add_to_course</span></tt>, that
takes an instance of the <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt> class and
an instance of the <tt><span class="builtin">Course</span></tt> class as
arguments.<br>
This function should assure that the <tt><span class="builtin">Student</span></tt>
is noted in the <tt><span class="builtin">Course</span></tt> instance and vice-versa.
