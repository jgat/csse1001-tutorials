<h1>Reject Tasks</h1>

<i>Tasks which have been written up and then thrown out in favour of other tasks.
Throwing them in here in case they end up being useful later.</i>

<h2>Week 11 (Recursion): Alphabetic Words</h2>

<i>Comment: This task was originally going to be a warm-up towards the
file-traversal one, but the task statement is a little too complicated.</i>

<p>
This task is to determine how two words should compare in an alphabetic
ordering, without distinguishing between lowercase and uppercase. Specifically,
write a function <tt>compare(a, b)</tt> which takes two strings, and returns
<tt>-1</tt> if <tt>a</tt> occurs before <tt>b</tt>
in alphabetic order, <tt>1</tt> if <tt>b</tt> occurs before <tt>a</tt>, and
<tt>0</tt> if they are the same word (up to capitalisation). The alphabetic
ordering of two words is defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If both strings are empty, then they are the same.</li>
<li>If just one of the strings is empty, then it occurs before the other.</li>
<li>If the first letter of each word is different, then the ordering of those
letters determines the ordering of the words.</li>
<li>If the first letter of each word is the same, then compare the remaining
words after removing the first letter from each.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'coconut'</span>, <span class="string">'Cocoon'</span>)
-1
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'swordfish'</span>, <span class="string">'sword'</span>)
1
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'AppLE'</span>, <span class="string">'aPple'</span>)
0
</pre>

<p>
It is safe to assume that both inputs contain only letters.
</p>


<h2>Week 2/3 (Intro): Tax Time</h2>

<i>Comment: Didn't have any room to put this task in week 2; it could probably go
in week 3.</i>

<p>
The Australian Tax Office applies the following income tax rates based on annual
income:
</p>

<div class="table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Taxable income</th><th>Tax on this income</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0 - $6,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr>
<tr><td>$6,001 - $37,000</td><td>15c for each $1 over $6000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$37,001 - $80,000</td><td>$4,650 plus 30c for each $1 over $37,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$80,001 - $180,000</td><td>$17,550 plus 37c for each $1 over $80,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$180,001 and over</td><td>$54,550 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Write a function <tt>calculate_tax</tt> which takes an integer representing
the taxable income of a person, and returns the amount of tax to pay (both in
dollars).
