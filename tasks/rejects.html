<h1>Reject Tasks</h1>

<i>Tasks which have been written up and then thrown out in favour of other tasks.
Throwing them in here in case they end up being useful later.</i>

<h2>Week 2/3 (Intro): Tax Time</h2>

<i>Comment: Didn't have any room to put this task in week 2 or 3, but it's
still a good task.</i>

<p>
The Australian Tax Office applies the following income tax rates based on annual
income:
</p>

<div class="table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Taxable income</th><th>Tax on this income</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0 - $6,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr>
<tr><td>$6,001 - $37,000</td><td>15c for each $1 over $6000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$37,001 - $80,000</td><td>$4,650 plus 30c for each $1 over $37,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$80,001 - $180,000</td><td>$17,550 plus 37c for each $1 over $80,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>$180,001 and over</td><td>$54,550 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Write a function <tt>calculate_tax</tt> which takes an integer representing
the taxable income of a person, and returns the amount of tax to pay (both in
dollars).
</p>

<h2>Week 5: Processing Data in a String</h2>

<i>Comment: Hard to make the task statement understandable; there are other
good tasks to use instead.</i>

<p>
A for loop allows you to iterate over an iterable sequence. This
means that you can construct a loop that will run once for each element in a 
sequence (for example, each value in a list or each character in a string).
</p>

<p>
In this task, we are given a string from which we wish to extract every character
before a particular character sequence is encountered.
</p>

<p>
Write a function, <tt><span class="builtin">string_before</span></tt>, which
takes two strings as arguments. The first is the string from which we aim to
extract the characters. The second is the delimiting sequence.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Hint:</b>
<p>
A <tt><span class="builtin">break</span></tt> statement can be used to terminate 
a while or for loop.
</p>
<p>
A <tt><span class="builtin">continue</span></tt> statement will cause a loop to
immediately move to the next item in the sequence.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span> for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if item % 2:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elif item == 6:
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print item
<span class="result"></span> 2
<span class="result"></span> 4
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Week 5: Using Enumerate</h2>

<i>Commment: Not enough room in the tutorial for this exercise.</i>

<p>it is often useful for a <tt><span class="builtin">for</span></tt> loop to
be able to access both the value of some element in a sequence and its index at
the same time. We can do this using the 
<tt><span class="builtin">enumerate</span></tt> function.
</p>

<p>
<tt><span class="builtin">enumerate</span></tt> generates a sequence of tuples, 
where the first item in the tuple is the index of the current in the sequence 
and the second item is its value. A <tt><span class="builtin">for</span></tt> 
loop can the iterate over both items at once.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Example:</b>
<pre>
<span class="prompt"></span> for index, item in enumerate('abc'):
<span class="prompt"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print index, item
<span class="result"></span> 0 a
<span class="result"></span> 1 b
<span class="result"></span> 2 c
</div>

<p>
The message below has been encoded using a very simple scheme: a random letter 
has been inserted before every second letter in the original message (starting 
with the first letter, ie indexed from 0).
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;encode(<span class="string">'Test of encoding function')</span>
<span class="result"></span> 'lTretsxty qocfz aeunrcoomdliknegv zfzuwnfcrtzixotn'
</pre>

<p>
In this task, you will need to write a <tt><span class="builtin">decode</span></tt>
that takes a single encoded string as an argument and returns the original message.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;decode(<span class="string">'lTretsxty qocfz aeunrcoomdliknegv zfzuwnfcrtzixotn')</span>
<span class="result"></span> 'Test of encoding function'
</pre>

<p>
This can also be done using string slicing in just one line!
</p>


<h2>Week 11 (Recursion): Alphabetic Words</h2>

<i>Comment: This task was originally going to be a warm-up towards the
file-traversal one, but the task statement is a little too complicated.</i>

<p>
This task is to determine how two words should compare in an alphabetic
ordering, without distinguishing between lowercase and uppercase. Specifically,
write a function <tt>compare(a, b)</tt> which takes two strings, and returns
<tt>-1</tt> if <tt>a</tt> occurs before <tt>b</tt>
in alphabetic order, <tt>1</tt> if <tt>b</tt> occurs before <tt>a</tt>, and
<tt>0</tt> if they are the same word (up to capitalisation). The alphabetic
ordering of two words is defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If both strings are empty, then they are the same.</li>
<li>If just one of the strings is empty, then it occurs before the other.</li>
<li>If the first letter of each word is different, then the ordering of those
letters determines the ordering of the words.</li>
<li>If the first letter of each word is the same, then compare the remaining
words after removing the first letter from each.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'coconut'</span>, <span class="string">'Cocoon'</span>)
-1
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'swordfish'</span>, <span class="string">'sword'</span>)
1
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> compare(<span class="string">'AppLE'</span>, <span class="string">'aPple'</span>)
0
</pre>

<p>
It is safe to assume that both inputs contain only letters.
</p>

<h2>Recursion: List Sorting</h2>

<i>A bit too hard for a warm-up task.</i>

<p>
Sorting a list of data is a common task in many applications of computing.
There are many different methods (or <i>algorithms</i>) for sorting data, one
such method, called <i>insertion sort</i> is as follows: first find the
smallest element, 'remove' it from the list, then sort the remaining elements,
and insert the smallest element back in front of the list.
</p>

<p>
Write a recursive function <tt>sort</tt> which takes a list, and returns a
sorted version of the list using this method.
</p>

<div class="important">
<b>Hint:</b>
<p>
It may help to use the <tt><span class="builtin">min</span></tt> function and
<tt>list.index</tt> method, as well as list slicing.
</p>

<pre>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> nums = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="builtin">min</span>(nums)
<span class="result">1</span>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> nums.index(1)
<span class="result">3</span>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> nums[3] == 1
<span class="result">True</span>
<span class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> nums[:3] + nums[4:]
<span class="result">[5, 2, 4, 3]</span>
</pre>
</div>
