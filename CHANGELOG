Version 1.1
-----------

Week 2:
* Added a super-challenge task.
* Renamed "Extension" task to "Challenge" task for consistency.

Week 3:
* Made the spiral task a "Challenge", since it's hard to complete all five
  tasks within the hour.
* Changed the `polygon` example to 7 sides, to catch students who do integer
  division (360/n).
* Added hints and tips to avoid common technical/implementation problems.

Week 4:
* Fixed a bug in the solutions (get_number) for when the number is at the end
  of the line.
* Changed one of the examples for get_number, since 'l' looks like '1'.
* Changed the "Extension" task to "Challenge" for consistency.

Week 6:
* Changed the get_score signature to include the scores dictionary.
* Fixed a typo in the sample usage for read_config.

Week 7:
* Changed the "Extension" task to "Challenge" for consistency.

Week 8:
* Fixed the solution to refer to the published task statement on course
  website, instead of referring to the copy in this repository.

Week 10:
* Fixed an error in the SettingsFrame docstring, left over from an early draft.

Week 11:
* Added a brief review and example of a recursive function at the beginning.
* Added alternative solutions to the minimum problem.
* Added a challenge task.

Week 12:
* Changed the time testing code to test different values of N, and to also test
  the worst case. Also made this change in the tutor solutions (with a little
  bit more code to extrapolate the N = 10**6 case).

Week 13:
* Turned the "Simon Says" task into a Challenge task.
